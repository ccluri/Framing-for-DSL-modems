* Framing for DSL modems

  The project involved the development of an algorithm to minimize the
  number of firmware test cases for the framing parameters. Also an interface was developed
  in Matlab to enable easy entry of input parameters to obtain the framing parameters in ADSL
  and VDSL transmissions, for a given choice of frequency plan.

  The supported DSL's are ADSL2, VDSL, ADSL2+ (all frequency plans)
